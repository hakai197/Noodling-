Book Goblin is a tracking program for book lovers like myself.  Those people who love to read and buy books faster than they can turn the page.  
I want to use this to keep track of the books I've read, want to re-read and books on by TBR.  
I also want it to keep track of those ponderus tomes that sit on my shelf that I forgot I bought in a rampant Half-Priced Books spree.  
Hoping to make it humorous and moblie.
